Project homepage is located at: https://github.com/RefuX/LayoutManagers-Fork

Improvements over LayoutManagers Version 0.6:
- GridLayout

Aims:
- Provide an easier way to do dynamic layouts in iOS.
    - Currenly if you have a UI where elements may or may not be displayed, the code is very icky.
        This simplfies the layout.
- Also aim to be NIB file friendly, I like to do my UIs in Interface Builder, I assume you do to.

Todo:
- Create an example using NIB files
- Improve examples
- Made inital values more NIB friendly
